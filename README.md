# Image_Inpainting
Matlab codes for some exemplar-based image inpainting/object removal algorithms. Including a variant exemplar-based and enhanced patch priority image inpainting algorithm developed during my master's study (2017-2020).

The code for Criminisi's algorithm are from: https://github.com/ikuwow/inpainting_criminisi2004. 
Other codes are developed based on it.
