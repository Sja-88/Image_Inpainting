# Image_Inpainting
Matlab codes for some exemplar-based image inpainting/object removal algorithms. Including an enhanced algorithm developed during my master's study.

The code for Criminisi's algorithm are from: https://github.com/ikuwow/inpainting_criminisi2004. 
Other codes are developed based on it.
